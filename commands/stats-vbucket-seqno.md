##Stats VBucket-Seqno

The Stats VBucket-Seqno command is used to obtain the current High Sequence Number/VBucket UUID for one or all VBuckets on a Couchbase node.

####Binary Implementation

See the stats command for details on the packet format for stats commands. Stats VBucket-Seqno can be used by placing the string "vbucket-seqno" into the key section of a stats packet to receive High Sequence Number/VBucket UUID pairs for all VBuckets on a given node. To receive a the High Sequence NUmber/VBucket UUID pair for a single VBucket then you can set the key in the stats command to "vbucket-seqno <vbid>".

#####Returns

The stats response from a Stats VBucket-Seqno command will look as follows:

    vb_0_high_seqno 45
    vb_0_vb_uuid 2723958720985
    vb_1_high_seqno 78
    vb_1_vb_uuid 7851085629020
    vb_2_high_seqno 56
    vb_2_vb_uuid 4560392056902
    ...

#####Errors

**PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_EINVAL (0x04)**

If data in this packet is malformed or incomplete then this error is returned.

**PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET (0x07)**

If you specified a specific VBucket and that VBucket does not exist.

#####Use Cases

This command is typically used before creating an UPR stream in order to find out what the sequence number is of the last mutation the server has for a given VBucket at the time the Stats VBucket-Seqno command was received.
