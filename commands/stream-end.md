###Stream End (opcode 0x55)

Sent to the consumer to indicate that the producer has no more messages to stream for the specified vbucket.

The request:
* Must have extras
* Must not have key
* Must not have value

The client should not send a reply to this command. The following
example shows the breakdown of the message:

    DCP_STREAM_END command
    Field        (offset) (value)
    Magic        (0)    : 0x80
    Opcode       (1)    : 0x55
    Key length   (2,3)  : 0x0000
    Extra length (4)    : 0x04
    Data type    (5)    : 0x00
    Vbucket      (6,7)  : 0x0000
    Total body   (8-11) : 0x00000004
    Opaque       (12-15): 0xdeadbeef
    CAS          (16-23): 0x0000000000000000
      flag       (24-27): 0x00000000 (OK)

The flags field is used to specify to the consumer why the stream was closed and will have one of the following values:

* *OK (0x00)* - The stream has finished without error.
* *Closed (0x01)* - This indicates that the close stream command was invoked on this stream causing it to be closed by force.
* *State Changed (0x02)* - The state of the VBucket that is being streamed has changed to state that the consumer does not want to receive.
* *Disconnected (0x03)* - The stream is closing because the connection is being disconnected.

###Returns

A status code indicating whether or not the operation was successful.

###Errors

**PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_KEY_ENOENT (0x01)**

If a stream does not exist for the vbucket specfied on this connection.

**PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_EINVAL (0x04)**

If data in this packet is malformed or incomplete then this error is returned.

**(Disconnect)**

If this message is sent to a connection that is not a consumer.
