#Protocol Specification

DCP utilizes the Memcached binary protocol as the basis for protocol definitions ([Memcached Binary Protocol Definitions](https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/BinaryProtocolRevamped)) and defines a set opcodes for DCP commands.

A DCP connection differs from the standard Memcached connections because DCP connections are full duplex while the normal Memcached connections are simplex (eg. the client sends a command, the server responds, etc).

The typical scenario begins with the client requesting a stream. Upon success the server starts sending messages back to the client for mutations/deletions/expirations etc. While receiving messages the client can send additional commands to the server to start additional DCP streams, etc.
